# Scoring the Feeling of Being Seen

## Purpose

There is a particular kind of laughter that a relatable meme produces. It is not the laughter of surprise, nor the laughter of absurdity. It is the laughter of recognition — the involuntary exhale that escapes when someone puts words or images to a feeling you assumed was yours alone. The purpose of score-meme-relatability is to measure that phenomenon: to evaluate how powerfully a single meme connects with the shared, often unspoken fabric of human experience.

Relatability is the engine behind a meme's ability to travel. A meme may be clever, well-designed, or topical, but if it does not make people feel personally seen, it remains an artifact admired at a distance. The memes that spread widest are the ones that make a viewer pause and think, "How did they know?" This function exists to score that invisible thread of connection — to quantify how broadly a meme reaches into the common well of human life and pulls up something familiar.

## Input

The function accepts a single meme as its input. A meme, in this context, is a self-contained unit of internet communication — typically an image paired with text, though it may also be a screenshot, a captioned photo, or a text-only format. The function does not compare memes against one another. It evaluates one meme in isolation, asking a focused question: how relatable is this, and to how many people?

This matters because relatability is not a competitive property. A meme about the quiet dread of a Sunday evening does not become less relatable because another meme about Monday mornings also exists. Each meme either taps into shared experience or it does not, and the function scores that quality on its own terms.

## Use-Cases

The applications for a relatability score are numerous. Content creators can use it to gauge whether their memes will land with a broad audience or only resonate within a narrow community. Social media strategists can prioritize relatable content in campaigns designed to maximize organic sharing, since relatability is one of the strongest predictors of whether someone will tag a friend or repost. Researchers studying internet culture can use the score to track how relatability trends shift over time — what felt universal a decade ago may feel dated today, and new shared experiences constantly emerge. Platform algorithms can incorporate relatability as a signal for surfacing content that fosters genuine engagement rather than passive scrolling.

In each of these cases, the score serves the same underlying need: distinguishing memes that speak to the many from those that speak to the few.

## Qualities and Values

Three core qualities must be evaluated to arrive at a relatability score. Each captures a different dimension of what it means for a meme to connect with a wide audience.

### 1. Universality of Experience

The most fundamental question is whether the meme references something that a broad cross-section of people have actually lived through. Relatability begins with shared reality. A meme about forgetting why you walked into a room, about the awkwardness of waving back at someone who was not waving at you, about the specific dread of hearing your full name spoken by a parent — these moments are not unique to any one culture, age group, or personality type. They are common enough that most people carry a memory of them.

A meme built on a universal experience has a natural advantage. It does not need to explain itself. The viewer does not need context or background knowledge. They simply recognize the moment being depicted because they have been there. Conversely, a meme rooted in a highly specific professional niche, a narrow fandom, or a local in-joke may be funny and well-crafted, but its relatability ceiling is inherently lower. This quality asks: how many people on earth have felt what this meme describes?

### 2. Emotional Resonance

Shared experience alone is not enough. A meme must also evoke a genuine emotional response — that internal spark of recognition that transforms a viewer from observer to participant. Emotional resonance is the difference between a meme that describes a common situation and one that captures exactly how that situation feels.

Consider the distinction between a meme that simply states "people procrastinate" and one that captures the very specific guilt of watching hours evaporate while knowing a deadline looms, paired with an image of someone smiling through visible panic. The second meme does not just reference procrastination; it recreates the emotional texture of the experience. It makes the viewer feel the feeling again, even if only for a moment. That re-experiencing is what triggers the impulse to share — the desire to point at the meme and say to a friend, "This is us." The stronger the emotional echo a meme produces, the higher it should score on relatability, because it is not merely depicting life but channeling it.

### 3. Accessibility

A meme can reference a universal experience and capture its emotional core, but if it requires specialized knowledge to decode, its relatability is compromised. Accessibility measures how easily a viewer can understand and connect with the meme without needing insider context, technical expertise, or familiarity with a particular subculture.

This quality is subtle because some of the most beloved memes use specific formats, templates, or referential humor. The question is not whether a meme uses a known format, but whether a newcomer encountering it would still grasp the emotional point. A meme about the exhaustion of small talk at parties is accessible even if the viewer has never seen the particular template before, because the feeling transcends the format. A meme that requires knowledge of a specific video game mechanic to understand the joke, however, has built a wall around its relatability — only those with the right key can enter.

Accessibility ensures that the emotional payload of a meme is not locked behind gates. The most relatable memes are generous in this way: they welcome everyone into the joke because the joke is life itself, and everyone is already living it.

## Conclusion

Relatability is not a single trait but a convergence of three forces: the breadth of the experience being depicted, the depth of the emotional response it provokes, and the openness with which it communicates. When a meme scores highly across all three — when it names a universal moment, recreates its emotional weight, and does so in a way that anyone can immediately grasp — it achieves something quietly remarkable. It makes strangers feel less alone. That is what this function measures, and that is why it matters.
