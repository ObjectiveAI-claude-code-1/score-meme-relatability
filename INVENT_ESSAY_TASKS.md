1. Assess the universality of the experience depicted in the meme. Determine whether the meme references a moment, feeling, or situation that a broad cross-section of people have actually lived through. A meme about forgetting why you walked into a room or the awkwardness of waving at someone who was not waving at you speaks to nearly everyone, while a meme rooted in a narrow professional niche, a specific fandom, or a local in-joke has a much lower relatability ceiling. The task is to judge how wide the circle of shared recognition is — how many people on earth have felt what this meme describes.

2. Evaluate the emotional resonance the meme produces. Determine whether the meme goes beyond merely referencing a common situation to actually recreating how that situation feels. A meme that states "people procrastinate" is not the same as one that captures the specific guilt of watching hours vanish while a deadline looms. The distinction is between describing life and channeling it. The task is to judge how powerfully the meme evokes that spark of recognition — the feeling of being personally seen — that transforms a viewer from passive observer into someone who wants to share the meme with others.

3. Evaluate how accessible the meme is to a general audience. Determine whether someone can understand and emotionally connect with the meme without needing specialized knowledge, insider context, technical expertise, or familiarity with a particular subculture. A meme about the exhaustion of small talk at parties is accessible to virtually anyone, while a meme that requires knowledge of a specific video game mechanic to understand the joke has built a wall around its relatability. The task is to judge whether the meme welcomes everyone into its emotional payload or restricts entry to those with niche background knowledge.
