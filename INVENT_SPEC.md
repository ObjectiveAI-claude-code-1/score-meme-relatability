Score a single meme on its relatability. Evaluate how broadly the meme connects with shared human experiences. Consider whether it taps into universal feelings, common frustrations, everyday joys, or widely recognized awkward moments that make viewers feel personally seen. A meme rooted in a broadly felt experience should score higher than one built around a niche or obscure scenario, because emotional resonance with a wide audience is what drives sharing and virality.
